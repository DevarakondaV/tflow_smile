# tflow_smile
This project is the tensorflow implementation of smile detector similar to opencv_smile.

The model consists of a CNN with common machine learning techqnies such as augmentation, batch normalization etc. The model was created in TFTrain_hp.ipynb file. The TFTrain.ipynb file contains essentially the same thing. However, TFTrain_hp.ipynb contains a function with which to call the model with different hyper-parameters. 

This network was able to achieve a validation accuracy of approximately 87% compared to 79% of the fully connected model described in opencv_smile.
